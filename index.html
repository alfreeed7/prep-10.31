<h2>Scale</h2>
<p>
A scale is a function that helps to represent the data in a different dataset within the speific range. Basically. it helps the input to be converted to the output. The unit of it is pixel. <br><br>
    It is really useful because using scale to plot or graph something can easily tell us the information about the data, like if there is any relationship in the dataset, if there is one, what is it? It will help create a really direct image of the data. Also, it is really useful in the way of helping see what type of data that we wants it to display. It is easier for designers to pick the type among all that designers can easily present the things they want.
